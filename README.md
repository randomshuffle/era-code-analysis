calc-dist.py is a python script that implements CalcDist (Fig 1 in ERA code analysis section of paper).

exponent-behavior.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that visualizes the behavior of E_{perm} as d_0, d_1, delta, r, c change.
The primary goal of the plots in the notebook is to motivate the proof of correctness of CalcDist.
In particular, it helps visualize the value of delta_2^* as defined in CalcDist.
